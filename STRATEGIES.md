## Sleeves (signal strategies)

| Sleeve | Mechanism | Universe | Key parameters | Standalone (Sharpe/CAGR/DD) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **rsi2_meanrev** | buy short-term dips in an uptrend (Connors RSI-2) | quality-10 | `rsi_period=2, entry_rsi=30, exit_rsi=50, trend_sma=100` | 0.87 / 5.1% / −9.0% |
| **donchian** | 20-day-high breakout, exit 10-day low | quality-10 | `entry_lookback=20, exit_lookback=10` | 0.94 / 7.1% / −12.8% |
| **trend_5020** | 50/200-day SMA trend filter | quality-10 | `fast=50, slow=200` | 1.12 / 15.3% / −24.9% |
| **xs_dualmom** | cross-sectional 12-1 momentum, top-K, cash in bear | **full S&P 500** | `lookback=252, skip=21, k=10, market_filter SPY>200d` | 1.26 / 36.2% / −34.4% |
| **recovery** | catch bull-run snapbacks: reclaim 50d after below 200d, hold | quality-10 | `hold_days=120` | 0.90 / 9.8% / −21.5% |
| **pead** | post-earnings drift: buy gap-up beats, hold the drift | **full S&P 500** | `gap_pct=0.05, vol_mult=2.0, hold_days=60` (live: 25 freshest) | 1.10 / 5.0% / −10.2% |

### Candidate sleeves (in the allocator pool; deploy only if they pass the gate)
| Sleeve | Mechanism | Parameters | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| trend_multi | multi-speed trend (avg of fast/med/slow crosses) | `speeds=[(20,100),(50,200),(100,300)]` | better trend sleeve; washes out in portfolio |
| turn_of_month | long the turn-of-month window | `pre=1, post=3` | low edge; in `defensive` book |
| zscore_revert | z-score mean reversion vs N-day mean | `lookback=20, entry_z=-2, exit_z=0, trend_sma=200` | rejected (weak) |
| abs_momentum | time-series momentum, long if >0 | `lookback=126` | redundant with trend |
| capitulation | buy extreme oversold (no trend filter) | `entry_rsi=5, exit_rsi=55, drop_pct=0.07` | rejected (no edge) |
| cross-sectional reversal | buy biggest losers | `lookback=3-5, k=30` | rejected (−35% DD) |
| managed-futures (proxy) | long/short TS-momentum across asset ETFs | 12-mo sign, inverse-vol | rejected (dilutive); see MANAGED_FUTURES_PROPOSAL.md |

## Overlays (applied on top of any book)

| Overlay | Rule | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Vol-targeting** | scale exposure so realized vol ≈ target (`--vol-target 0.15`, `--max-leverage 1.6`); de-levers when vol rises | controls drawdown; conditional leverage in calm markets |
| **Idle-cash → T-bills** | park `1 − invested` in **BIL** (`--park-cash BIL`) | riskless yield (~4–5%) on idle capital, esp. in lean years |
| **Early-warning de-risk** | cut exposure to 60% when **SPY < 50-day AND 20-day vol > 20%** | front-runs the lagging 200-day bear signal (Sharpe 1.45→1.48, DD −13.8%→−11.7%) |
| **Dual-momentum filter** | xs sleeve holds only when **SPY > 200-day** | cross-sectional sleeve goes to cash in bears |
| **Regime detection** | SPY vs 200-day + 20-day vol → BULL_CALM / BULL_VOL / BEAR | printed each run; drives `regime_adaptive` |
| **No-trade band** | skip reconcile orders < $250 | controls churn/cost |
| **Fractional orders** | dollar-sized (notional) market orders | exact weights on high-priced names |

## Regime handling (bull ↔ bear)
- **Bull → bear** (SPY crosses below 200-day): trend/momentum sleeves → cash, recovery dormant, RSI-2 blocked below trend, vol-target de-risks, early-warning cuts to 60%, cash → T-bills. (Why the book made +33% in the 2022 bear.)
- **Bear → bull**: the **recovery** sleeve fires when price reclaims the 50-day after being below the 200-day — catching snapbacks (early-2019, spring-2020).
- The 200-day is *lagging* (confirms a bear after ~10–15% drop); the early-warning + vol-target reduce that lag.

## Universe & data
- **Per-ticker sleeves** (rsi2, donchian, trend, recovery): quality-10 = SPY, QQQ, GLD, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, JPM, UNH, XOM.
- **Cross-sectional sleeves** (xs_dualmom, pead): full S&P 500 (`--xs-universe sp500`).
- Data: split/dividend-adjusted daily bars (yfinance); `DAILY_USE_ADJUSTED=0` forces raw parquet.

## Honest caveats
Long-biased equity book, validated 2016–2026 (one decade, one out-of-sample window).
Not market-neutral; lean years (2018-style) are cushioned by cash yield + recovery
sleeve but still low-single-digit on the strategy side. Live PEAD caps to 25 names
(vs uncapped backtest). Paper-trade before real capital. See BOARD_SUMMARY.md and
LESSONS.md for the full record.
